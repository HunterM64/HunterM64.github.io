            <p>I am an aspiring software engineer!</p>
            
            <p>Currently working on my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at OSU! Expected graduation is May 2023!</p>
            
            <p>My hobbies include photography, listening to music, playing video games, and reading, and programming!</p>

            <p> 
                I got into computer science and programming sometime around middle or high school. 
                It probably started when one of my English teachers lent me the book "The Innovaters" by Walter Isaacson.
                I had done a book report on "Steve Jobs", another book done by this author, and she thought that I would
                enjoy reading it due to my interest in computers. Needless to say, I very much enjoyed the book and now 
                have two copies of my own- a physical and digital copy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Later on in high school, I discovered the joys of programming when someone showed me how he could program his
                calculator to do math equations for him. I quickly started to learn how to do the same, and had a fun time
                experimenting with anything else I could program my TI-84 to do. I was also introduced to Scratch in one of my
                computer courses, and quickly became addicted to that as well. It was from there that I started to look more into things
                and decided that computer science and engineering was something that I wanted to pursue academically and professionally.
