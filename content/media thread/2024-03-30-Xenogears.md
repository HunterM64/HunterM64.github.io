From the original Twitter post:

> Yeah disc 2 is what it is and a remake with it fully realized would be the best thing ever in the whole world but god I loved the game regardless, amazing story, amazing characters.

I recorded (most) of my playthrough using an old Elgato Game Capture HD hooked up to my Mid 2012 Macbook Pro, and have it uploaded on my Youtube channel. The 'most' part is because some parts got lost, most regrettably a large portion of the endgame, including the entire Lighthouse section. I still have my memories, at least.
