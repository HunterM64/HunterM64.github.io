From the original Twitter post:

> Really good manga with some really amazing art. At first I found myself thinking that it was just okay, and that the fight scenes were kinda repetitive, but those aren’t really the important parts, it’s more of what happens in between that matters,
> And those inbetween parts were really really good. I do wish that some of the characters would’ve had more time to get more developed, but it is what it is. 

Major thanks to one of my friends for letting me borrow his entire collection for months until I finally got around to reading it.
