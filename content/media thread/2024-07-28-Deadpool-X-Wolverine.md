From the original Twitter post:

> I donâ€™t entirely know how to sum up my thoughts but I had a great time watching the movie, a lot of laughs, a lot of great action sequences. I loved seeing the characters they brought into the film, and it was gay as shit which is pretty cool

For a bit of real life context, the reason there's such a large gap between this and the previous media thread entry, I got a new job and moved out of my parent's house! So that was exciting and also really busy.
