> Itâ€™s very easy to lose track of your character with the kinda bad camera and everything just kind of blending together color wise, so next thing you know youâ€™ll just be trapped in a corner, swarmed by enemies. And in coop thereâ€™s only one shared revive, and health potions are very rare. Game over? Well no checkpoints regardless of how far you are into the level, so have fun starting from the beginning again!
