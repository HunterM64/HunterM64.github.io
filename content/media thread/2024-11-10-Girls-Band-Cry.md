From the original Bluesky post:

> Man this show is amazing Iâ€™m so glad itâ€™s officially available in the US now.

> I love the story and the cast and the animation style is absolutely delightful, I would definitely recommend watching it.

I went on a bit of a rant after this post, also related to my feelings after watching Look Back, so here's that:

> I really need to express myself in some way ðŸ˜­ Iâ€™ve dabbled in game dev before because I know programming but because Iâ€™m me I have to work solo and thereâ€™s a lot of other skills Iâ€™d need that I donâ€™t really have, like art and sound design and story writing, but I guess I should still try regardless.

> Iâ€™ve always wanted to write a story. Iâ€™d write stories and read books about writing stories back when I was younger, but I havenâ€™t written anything in a long time now. I think Iâ€™m just too afraid to try knowing that I wonâ€™t be good at first, but thatâ€™s so fucking dumb because obviously!

> I canâ€™t get better at something I never do. I just need to fucking do it, even if Iâ€™m the only one who ever sees it. I hold myself back far too often for my own good because Iâ€™m scared of the reactions of others. Fuck them, why should I care. Why do I care so much. I need to get over myself.
