From the original Twitter post:

> Man I like piloting mechs. Reverse joint legs quickly became a favorite of mine (Spring Chicken ðŸ«¶) but I did experiment with other builds depending on the mission. Overall, the gameplay was tight, and Iâ€™ll comment on story once Iâ€™ve seen it all

Don't get too excited on that last bit, I still have yet to go through the other endings of the game at the time of writing (November 14th, 2024). Maybe one day. It's not that I didn't like the game, I just started other games and didn't come back to this one.
