This movie makes me cry every time I watch it.

If you've already read the previous Evangelion entry, you'll know how much I love this movie, so of course I jumped at the opportunity to go see it in theaters. It was amazing, totally worth it. This was also the first time I had ever gone outside with my nails fully painted, in Unit-01 colors of course, so that was cool too I suppose. I still have the ticket, inside one of those thick plastic trading card holders.
