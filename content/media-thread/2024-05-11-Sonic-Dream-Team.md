This game would be so great if more people could actually play it.

I got an offer for 3 months of free Apple Arcade when I upgraded my iPhone, and then I later went and got a used M1 Mac Mini from eBay, so I decided one thing I could do is try out this game, and I'm glad I did! I really enjoyed playing through it.
