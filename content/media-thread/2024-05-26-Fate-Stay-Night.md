Fate is really cool!

From the original Twitter post: 

> As someone who barely knew anything about Fate going into this, it was quite an enjoyable watch, I was happy to learn more about these characters that Iâ€™ve only really seen in art before, and I definitely want to get into more of the Fate project now!

One of my friends and I wanted to get into Fate, so I 'obtained' a copy of this anime and we binged it all in a single day. I know people don't like this one as much as the other anime adaptations, and yeah I can definitely understand that, but this one certainly isn't bad by any means. Definitely worth checking out if you're interested.
