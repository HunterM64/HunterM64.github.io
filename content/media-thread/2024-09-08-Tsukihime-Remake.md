I first learned about Tsukihime through Melty Blood. Yes, it was because of Neco-Arc. But it was before Type Lumina came out so surely I get at least some swag points for playing Actress Again Current Code. It's really fun to play, I love how the moon styles can really change how a character gets played.

Arcuied is so god damn cute it literally hurt sometimes. I would absolutely recommend you play (read?) this.

I actually didn't know that Neco-Arc originated in Tsukihime, I thought they were originally from Melty Blood, so after beating the Arcuied route and watching the 'Teach Me, Ciel-sensei!' segment, I got jumpscared when the gremlin appeared on my screen.
