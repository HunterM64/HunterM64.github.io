My friend recommended that I watched this before the Heaven's Feel trilogy, and now I really want to see Zouken Matou die. I really hope that happens.

> Wow I really enjoyed this. I found all of the characters to be super good, and I liked the darker tone the story took. Would definitely recommend watching!
