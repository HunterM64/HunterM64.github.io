My first entry not based on a previous Twitter or Bluesky post!

I originally bought this manga the day after I watched the anime when I went out shopping with my friends. 

Honestly, I think I'm more confused by this ending than the anime's, but I really loved the artstyle. I looked up the illustrator, Hajime Ueda, and they only have a couple other manga that they worked on, so I definitely want to look in to those.
