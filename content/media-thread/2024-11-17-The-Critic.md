To be honest, most of my time watching this I was just using it as background noise while I worked.

My friends had me watch this for a reason I can't remember anymore. We started with Season 2 but it was late at night so I fell asleep a few episodes in and missed like half of it. After that I went back to Season 1 and watched the whole thing through. Honestly shorter than what I expected it to be, but I guess there's probably only so much you can do with the format. 

There were like 3 jokes where the punchline was 'hah, transgender', and it felt like it came out of left field every single time, so that was something I suppose. There was also a lot of gay jokes in a similar manner but those were much more frequent and didn't feel so out of place I suppose.
