This'll be the page where I talk about M64n't and its history.

M64n't was originally conceived when I was still in high school. I already knew at this point that I liked programming, and wanted to try something a little more advanced before I got into college. 

I can't entirely remember how I decided on a Discord bot, I've never been a very active participant in Discord servers, but I do remember using bots a lot in this Pokemon server I was in to look up things like stats and movepools, so that was probably the impetus. 

Originally, the bot started out using JavaScript's discord.io, but I switched to Python soon after because I found the API easier to use. 

Ever since the start the goal was to run this off of my Raspberry Pi 3B, which it still does today whenever I remember to plug the thing in.
