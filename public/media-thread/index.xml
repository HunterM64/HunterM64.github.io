      <description>From the original Twitter post:&#xA;I cried.&#xA;And then,&#xA;I cried some more.&#xA;I originally wrote this under the context of it being about episodes 24 and 25, and End of Evangelion, because those make me cry like a bitch when I watch them. They mean a lot to me and they&amp;rsquo;re easily my favorite parts of the series.&#xA;I watched about half of the series with two of my good friends on my CRT in the basement of my parent&amp;rsquo;s house, and that was a lot of fun.</description>

      <description>From the original Twitter post:&#xA;Regardless of anything else I can say, the fact that A Realm Reborn took me several months spread over a couple years and I went through all of Heavensward in 5 days says a lot about how much I loved this expansion. A few gripes, but overall amazing.</description>

      <description>From the original Twitter post:&#xA;best christmas gift ever. a wonderful 13 episode anime with each having a self-contained story. both protagonists are great and the show is plenty humorous but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t slouch on serious moments either. 10/10</description>

      <description>Sure did start off my 2024 media thread strong with this one.&#xA;From the original Twitter post:&#xA;yeah starting this a few days early but i watched this in the background while trying to get sonic schoolhouse working in a windows xp virtual machine and i must say that was much more entertaining than this &amp;ldquo;comedy&amp;rdquo; ngl, not even that triggering it was just bad&#xA;Needless to say I didn&amp;rsquo;t really care for it.</description>
