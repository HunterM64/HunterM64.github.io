background

I am an aspiring software engineer!
I graduated magna cum laude from the Ohio State University in May of 2023, earning my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Engineering.
My hobbies include photography, listening to music, playing video games, reading, and programming, of course!

I first got into computer science and programming sometime in middle school, when my English teacher lent me the book "The Innovators" by Walter Isaacson.
This book tells the story of the people who created computers and the Internet, starting from Ada Lovelace. I really enjoyed reading this book, and it deepend 
my already growing interest in computers and technology. 


The first programming languages I ever used were two different variations of BASIC: TI-BASIC and SmileBASIC. The first is the dialect of BASIC used in Texas Instrument calculators.
I used to spend time during my math classes making programs to calculate various formulas that I would use for homework and quizzes. SmileBASIC is what's used in a DSi game called Petit Computer.
This let you write programs in BASIC, primarily focused on games, and even share them with other people using generated QR codes. I liked downloading games and then going through the code to find ways to cheat,
like removing collision detection functions or just giving myself infinite lives. It was from there that I started to look more in to programming as a career, decided that I wanted to pursue a computer science degree in college, 
and here I am now.
